# EvolutionSimulationGenetics
cd to src and "python .\runSimulation.py"

make sure you have all dependencies installed. I used pip to install pygame and numpy :)
## Picture of the game

## Explaination:
Samples represent a population/generation. There are obstacles that are set in the environment as they are trying to reach the point of most "fitness".

Use fitness level to determine parents that are more likely to be chosen for child functions and have them procreate with occasional mutations.

Make sure generations keep populating from the parents as long as the simulation is still running.

Generations will become more selective and fit, and each run of the game outputs randomized vectors, obstables, and fitness goal.
